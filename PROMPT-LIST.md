give me comprehensive overview between the abstracts of paper title [X] to [Y]. then make bullet points of the difference between each research. and finally compile the impact of high intake sugar for young adults, if given by each abstract
```

```text
what should be done if we take too much sugar as young adult, based on the abstracts provided? only answer in bullet points and give reference to each point that refers the source of the answer. example answer:
- answer 1. [Paper title reference]
- answer 2. [Paper title reference]
don't answer outside that format

# specific paper question
what is the adequate intake for fiber for each adult women and men? and what is the research title reference to that based on the context given?

question:
- gimana caranya bisa ngasih feedback ke chain dan kedisplay di langsmith
- ada istilah `my_chain.with_config` mungkin bisa di-explore lebih jauh
- langserve sepertinya kudu make FastAPI (?) kalo make streamlit gimana kurang tau configure-nya
  - nemu integrasi langchain feedback ke streamlit app buat dicek di langserve
